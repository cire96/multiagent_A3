# multiagent_A3

Car Soccer code is inside the scrips folder, same folder architecture as for the project in unity. Behaviour tree in code needs NPBehave to run, which is available as an asset from the unity store (free) or from its git repository. We also made the small change in CarController.cs and we added a component script to the ball it called WhoBall.cs it's in the root of the assets folder
